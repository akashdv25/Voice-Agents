#Brief of how the flow works

1.Calling is routed through vapi to the customer number.
2. I have integrated twilio to make the call as international number support was not available in vapi.
3. The script make_call.py is used to make the call, it takes phone number id , (ai) assistant id and (vapi) api key from the .env file.
4. With the help of requests library we hit the vapi api endpoint /call to make the call.
5. I have created a fastapi server to handle the server events responses from vapi.
6. The webhook is used to save the call logs to a csv file locally.
7. The csv file is saved in the root directory.
8. We used ngrok to expose the local server to the internet , as vapi needs a public url to send the webhook (server events)
9.You can find all the details of the call in the csv file.
