- When Vapi dispatches events to a server, it must be able to reach the server via the open Internet 
- We can use ngrok to forward the local server to the internet 
- These events will go to the Ngrok URL & get tunnelled to our local machine.
- We will see the event payloads come through locally & log them in our terminal.
